Role rules are data in `src/config/roles.ts` (`ROLE_HOME`, `ROLE_ACCESS`, `canAccess()`, `SHELL`) and nav
per role in `src/config/nav.ts`. `SHELL[role]` picks the chrome: members get the simple bar
(logo, Raise | Dashboard, profile - `SimpleShell`), leaders and managers the rail + top bar. Enforcement (`src/proxy.ts` + the `(app)` layout) arrives with
sessions in Phase 2; until then every app page renders with the demo tenant as manager.

Layouts nest: `app/layout.tsx` (html, fonts) -> `(marketing)/layout.tsx` (header, footer) or
`[company]/layout.tsx` (resolve tenant, 404) -> `(app)/layout.tsx` (AppShell: rail + top bar)
-> `settings/layout.tsx` (sub-nav). Auth pages compose `AuthShell` themselves.
